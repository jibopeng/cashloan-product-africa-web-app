            <h3>Information we may receive from third parties:</h3>
            <p>If you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, through Facebook Connect, by “following”, “liking”, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Gocredit.  This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to set up a credit score, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service by sending them a direct message or email – which might not be free, depending on your mobile operation service. </p>
            <p>You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Gocredit Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. Finding your friends on the Service: Gocredit may develop a feature that allows you to locate your friends with Gocredit accounts and access their credit history on the platform. This feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through:</p>
            <p>(i) social media sites (such as Facebook),</p>
            <p>(ii) through a search of names and usernames on Gocredit.</p>

            <h3>How we might use the previous information:</h3>
            <p>The data obtained from the previous paragraphs might be used to:</p>
            <p>– Build your credit scoring decision and improve our credit scoring model.</p>
            <p>– Analytics information: We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>
            <p>– Cookies information:  When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Gocredit help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy.</p>
            <p>– Log file information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, the number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.   </p>
            <p>– Clear gifs/web beacons information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
            <p>– Device identifiers: When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Gocredit. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>

We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions, and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related emails. You may also be able to be “found” on Gocredit based on information that you provide. Use of certain service type information we collect about you: We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to</p>

            <p>We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “Shareing your information.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</p>
            <h3>How We Store and Protect Your Information Storage and Processing:</h3>

            <p>– The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside Nigeria. It may also be processed by staff operating outside Nigeria, who work for us or for one of our suppliers. These staff members may be engaged in the fulfillment of your requests on the App or the provision of Services to you. By submitting your personal data, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage or processing of your personal data in the manner set out above. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated, stored and processed securely and in accordance with this Policy.</p>
            <p>– Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of the App, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the App; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

           <h3>Keeping your information safe:</h3>
            <p>Gocredit cares about the security of your information and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Gocredit, at all times. However, Gocredit cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Gocredit or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Gocredit Service, such as social networks. Gocredit is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party. </p>
            <h3>Compromise of information: </h3>
            <p>In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Gocredit will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.  </p>
